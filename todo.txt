Quest:
  - Status should be "pending" if the current date is less than the start date, "ongoing" if the current date is between the start and end dates and "completed" if the current date is greater than the end date.

  - Fields arranged in a column: "Current level" (text), "Shift" (number).
  - Each field should have a label above it.
  - Current level should be disabled and prefilled with the number.
  - Shift should have a placeholder "change" and be required.
  - Two buttons "Update" and "Revert" at the bottom of the form.
  - Click on "Revert" should return fields to the state upon entering the screen.
  - Click on "Update" should display the "Main Menu" screen with the updated confidence level.
